*** How to approach Recursion ***
1. Divide a problem into subproblems.
    a. must be the same type as the original
2. Solve those subproblems.
3. Combine the results to solve the original


*** Part of a Recursive Solution ***
1. Base case / degenerate case (Stopping Condition)
    a. "How do I know when I'm done recursing?"
    b. Smallest slice of the problem is treated differently.
2. Recursive case / progress
    a. Continue reducing the problem until reaching the base case.
